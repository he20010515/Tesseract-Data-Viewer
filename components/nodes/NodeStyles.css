/* Custom hover logic for Inspect Button to prevent nested triggers */

/* 
   By default, the button is hidden (opacity-0 in Tailwind).
   We override it here when hovered.
*/
.cell-hover-trigger:hover > .cell-inspect-btn {
  opacity: 1;
  pointer-events: auto;
}

/* 
   The Magic Fix:
   If a nested cell (which also has .cell-hover-trigger) is hovered,
   this selector matches the PARENT cell.
   We force the parent's button to hide, so only the inner button is visible.
